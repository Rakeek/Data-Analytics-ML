# Data Visualization and Machine Learning Projects

This repository contains two Jupyter Notebook projects that explore data visualization and prediction using machine learning models. Each project is focused on a unique dataset, one related to TV shows and the other to lifestyle sustainability. 

## Projects Overview

### 1. Data Visualization & ML Project on Lifestyle Sustainability

This project analyzes and visualizes data on lifestyle sustainability, examining various factors that impact sustainable living. Using machine learning, the project also predicts sustainability scores based on key lifestyle factors.

#### Key Steps:
- **Data Cleaning**: Preprocessed data to handle missing values and standardize formats.
- **Data Visualization**: Explored trends and correlations between lifestyle choices and sustainability scores through histograms, scatter plots, and bar charts.
- **Machine Learning Model**: Built a predictive model to estimate sustainability scores based on selected lifestyle features.

#### Libraries Used:
- `pandas` and `numpy` for data manipulation
- `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for data visualization
- `scikit-learn` for machine learning model development

### 2. Data Visualization & ML Project on TV Shows

This project provides insights into TV shows, focusing on visualizing trends in ratings, genres, and popularity. Additionally, it includes a machine learning component to predict show ratings based on features like genre, number of seasons, and other relevant factors.

#### Key Steps:
- **Data Cleaning**: Removed duplicates and handled missing values to prepare the dataset for analysis.
- **Data Visualization**: Created visualizations such as box plots, line charts, and heatmaps to explore show ratings and trends by genre and season count.
- **Machine Learning Model**: Developed a model to predict TV show ratings, leveraging features extracted from the dataset.
  
#### Libraries Used:
- `pandas` and `numpy` for data manipulation
- `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for data visualization
- `scikit-learn` for machine learning model development

These projects showcase data visualization and predictive modeling for educational purposes. They can serve as templates for analyzing different datasets and implementing machine learning techniques.
